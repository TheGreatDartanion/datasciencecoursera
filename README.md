The week 3 course project requires us to 

<ul>
<li>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.</li>
<li>5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ul>
Execute run_analysis.R which will produce the result set for tiny_data that is a required submission for the course.
